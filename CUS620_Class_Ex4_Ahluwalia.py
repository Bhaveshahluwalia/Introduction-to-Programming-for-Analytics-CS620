# # 5 Tuples

# # Exercise 5.1: Swapping two values
# Suppose you have two variables: a and b. Now you want to set a equal to the value of b and at the same time set b equal to the value of a.
# 
# The following obviously does not work
# a=b 
# b=a
# 
# so in some languages, you need to define a third variable like this
# 
# t=a 
# a=b
# b=t
# 
# However, in Python you donâ€™t need to do this. How can you swap a and b in one line?

# In[14]:



a=50
b=100
a,b = b,a #it takes the values of the right side by creating a tuple (b,a). Then this tuple is unpacked and assigned to the variables in the reverse order.
print ("After Swapping values of a =",a) 
print ("After Swapping values of b =",b) 


# # Exercise 5.2: Zip
# Suppose we have two lists, x and y that give the x and y coordinates of a set of points. Create a list with the coordinates (x,y) as a tuple. Hint: Find out about the zip function.
# 
# You have decided that actually, you need the two seperate lists, but unfortunately, you have thrown them away. How can we use zip to unzip the list of tuples to get two lists again?

# In[88]:


classno = ['Sql', 'Introduction to' , 'data'] 
classname = ['database', 'python', 'mining'] 
zipped = list(zip(classno, classname)) # this will join the each value of two list together in order form
print(zipped)


# In[89]:


res = list(zip(*zipped)) # here we can use unpacking operator * to unzip the data and print them separatly
print("Two lists of tuples After unzip the zip function \n ")
print (list(res))


# # Exercise 5.3: Distances
# Suppose we have two vectors, x and y, stored as tuples with n elements. Implement functions that compute the l1 and l2 distances between x and y. Note that n is not explicitly given.

# In[44]:


a=[9,8,7,6,5,9,8,9,9,0]
b=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0]


# In[45]:


# not sure about this coz n is not explicitly given.
def distance(a,b):
    for i in range(len(a)): # for loop since we donot know how long the n elements in x and y vector
        out= a[i]-b[i]
        print (out)
distance(a,b)


# # 7 File I/O

# Exercise 7.1: Open a file
# Write a function that opens a file (input: filename), and prints the file line by line.

# In[5]:

    inFile = input("enter name of input file> ")
    inf = open(inFile,'r')
